My project was functional with the four pages but pycharm is not recognizing some of my modules and keeps asking me to reinstall them. I tried searching up on stack overflow and in Google in general. I think the problem came down to using WSL and also having ubuntu which kept causing troubles. I was using ubuntu for another class and I think it changed some of my settings on my laptop os that is needed for WSL to work. I tried figuring it out.
