Trying to figure out why it is not working. Installed the package but pycharm doesn't recongnize it and wants to keep installing it.

My project was functional with the four pages but pycharm is not recognizing some of my modules and keeps asking me to reinstall them. I tried searching up on stack overflow and in Google in general. I think the problem came down to using WSL and also having ubuntu which kept causing troubles. I was using ubuntu for another class and I think it changed some of my settings on my laptop os that is needed for WSL to work. I tried figuring it out.
